RubyInstaller-2.5.1-2 and RubyInstaller-2.4.4-2 are released.
These maintenance releases fix a bug in `ridk install` which prevented the download of MSYS2 and update to the MSYS2 installer version 20180531.
More details are provided in the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller2/blob/1dfa3f5e407345f11936da21c578e426f76d55a8/CHANGELOG.md).

Since at the [last release]({% post_url 2018-03-29-rubyinstaller-2.5.1-1-and-2.4.4-1-released %}) two flavors of installers are provided: RubyInstaller with and without MSYS2 Devkit.
As usual all binaries are available in the [Download section]({{ "/downloads/" | relative_url }})!
