These new releases of Ruby address a security issue ([CVE-2015-7551](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2015/12/16/unsafe-tainted-string-usage-in-fiddle-and-dl-cve-2015-7551/)). 2.1.8 and 2.2.4 also address some bugs and fixes. Upgrading to those versions is recommended. You can find the links to those archives in the download section.
