It includes several security and many bug-fixes. See the [ruby-2.4.2 release post](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2017/09/14/ruby-2-4-2-released/) and the [the RubyInstaller CHANGELOG](https://github.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller2/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for more details.

All binaries are available in the [Download section]({{ "/downloads/" | relative_url }})!

A previous RubyInstaller-2.4.x installation can be updated by installing the new version into the same directory.
Installed gems are not overwritten and will work with the new version without re-installation.
If the previous RubyInstaller version is 2.4.1-1, it's recommended to run `ridk install` once again, as offered on the last install page.
