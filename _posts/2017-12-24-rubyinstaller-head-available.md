RubyInstaller-head is a daily updated version of the [Ruby development branch called "trunk"](https://github.com/ruby/ruby/).
It can be used to do continious integration tests (CI) on your gems or applications, so that you're prepared for upcoming changes to the ruby core.

Both x86 and x64 builds are available on stable download URIs in the [github release section](https://github.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller2/releases/tag/rubyinstaller-head).
They can be easily [integrated into Appveyor](https://github.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller2/wiki/For-gem-developers#user-content-appveyor).
