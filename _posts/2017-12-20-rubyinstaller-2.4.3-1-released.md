RubyInstaller-2.4.3-1 is released. It's a [maintenance release of ruby-2.4](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2017/12/14/ruby-2-4-3-released/) with some bug and security fixes.

All binaries are available in the [Download section]({{ "/downloads/" | relative_url }})!

A previous RubyInstaller-2.4.x installation can be updated by installing the new version into the same directory.
Installed gems are not overwritten and will work with the new version without re-installation.
