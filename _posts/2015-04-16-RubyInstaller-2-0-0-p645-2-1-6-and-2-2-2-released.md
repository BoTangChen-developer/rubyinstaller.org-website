These new releases of Ruby address a security issue ([CVE-2015-1855](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2015/04/13/ruby-openssl-hostname-matching-vulnerability/)). 2.1.6 and 2.2.2 also address some bugs and fixes. Upgrading to those versions is recommended. You can find the links to those archives in the download section.
