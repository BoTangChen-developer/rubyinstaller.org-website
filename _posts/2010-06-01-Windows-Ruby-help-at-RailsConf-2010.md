This year at [RailsConf](http://en.oreilly.com/rails2010), Luis Lavena (one of the RubyInstaller project developers) will be attending.
Since there will be no official Ruby for Windows talk, presentation or tutorials, he wants to catch up with any Ruby developer using Windows and help them out getting the most of the environment.
Just [follow him](http://twitter.com/luislavena) on Twitter to know where he will be so you can jump to the same table and hack with him :-)
