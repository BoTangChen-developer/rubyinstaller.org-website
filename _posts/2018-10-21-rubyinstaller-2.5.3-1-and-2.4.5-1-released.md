RubyInstaller-2.5.3-1 and RubyInstaller-2.4.5-1 are released.
These are maintenance releases with bug and security fixes.
See [ruby-2.4.5 release notes](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2018/10/17/ruby-2-4-5-released/) and [ruby-2.5.2 release notes](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2018/10/17/ruby-2-5-2-released/).
Bundled OpenSSL versions are updated to 1.0.2p and 1.1.1.

The installer executables are now signed with a Microsoft trusted certificate of "Open Source Developer Lars Kanis".
This should give some confidence about the downloaded files and should soften the disposition of anti virus products.

More details are provided in the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller2/blob/16e7aa4159fab5413b01ed1ca9917f9e39500303/CHANGELOG.md#rubyinstaller-253-1---2018-10-21).
All binaries are available in the [Download section]({{ "/downloads/" | relative_url }})!
